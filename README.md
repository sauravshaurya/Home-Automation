# Home-Automation
Cloud Computing based smart home automation system using raspberry pi and arduino using Cayenne which is an open source IoT platform.
The communication between raspberry pi and the cloud is performed by MQTT protocol.
Due to the use of cloud it can be access by anywhere in the world.

Future Planing :
o	Detection of potential electric short points and warning, as a pre-emptive equivalent of an MCB.
o	Complete automation based on the advent of Al, which will handle all routine tasks in and around the residence. The system learns the user's usage patterns and gets better over time.
o	To make the sophisticated system simpler for user so that they can add additional equipment by they own by the use CMS.
o	Appling the method of AI and Machine learning for automatic gardening system due to which the sensors are eliminated.
o	Smart power management system which consume power according to the consumer budget.
o	Video surveillance.
o	Detection of unknown person and known person on the basis of their voice and notify the user via mail. 
o	Automatic temperature control on the basis of outside atmosphere.
o	Accurately detection the location of electric wiring fault.
o	Chat bot for controlling the equipment via messages system using NLP.
