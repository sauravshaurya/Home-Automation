# Home-Automation
Security systems have not kept pace with time for the masses, as majority of the population still relies on traditional lock and key mechanisms. Although a cheap and proven option, these systems are now obsolete.

•	They can be very easily broken.
•	The key acts as an only control port for entry, and hence losing it will cause the entire system to fail.
•	Such systems do not provide any safety features against various hazards encountered in modern households.
•	They do not utilize any technological benefits of the 21st century that can otherwise make life more convenient & hassle free.

However automated security systems in the market today tend to be very costly, and unaffordable for the majority of the population. They also tend to be overly complicated in their implementation. This is where our project shines.

Our objective is to:
•	Give access to authenticated users
•	Can be access by anywhere in the world
•	End-to-end encryption
•	Every device has a unique id
•	Real-time data transmission
•	Manual and automated control of all devices
•	Task can be schedule for any time for future use
•	Give access to home to authenticated personnel.
•	Give notification for every task at the time of initialization as well as finalization through message as well as email


Cloud Computing based smart home automation system using raspberry pi and arduino based on Cayenne which is an open source IoT platform.
The communication between raspberry pi and the cloud is performed by MQTT protocol.
Due to the use of cloud it can be access by anywhere in the world.

Future Planing :
Detection of potential electric short points and warning, as a pre-emptive equivalent of an MCB.
Complete automation based on the advent of Al, which will handle all routine tasks in and around the residence. The system learns the user's usage patterns and gets better over time.
To make the sophisticated system simpler for user so that they can add additional equipment by they own by the use CMS.
Appling the method of AI and Machine learning for automatic gardening system due to which the sensors are eliminated.
Smart power management system which consume power according to the consumer budget.
Video surveillance.
Detection of unknown person and known person on the basis of their voice and notify the user via mail.
Automatic temperature control on the basis of outside atmosphere.
Accurately detection the location of electric wiring fault.
Chat bot for controlling the equipment via messages system using NLP.
